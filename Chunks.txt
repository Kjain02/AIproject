7. Provide details of greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) & its intensity, in the following format75:
 The Scope 1 emissions ar
e from direct GHG sources like fuel used in company owned vehicles, diesel generators and cafeteria, 
fugitive emissions of refrigerants, and fuel used for space heating. Scope 1 accounts for about 23% of the Scope 1 + Scope 2 
carbon footprint in FY 2023-24. The balance 77% are from indirect emissions, referred to as Scope 2 emissions, associated with purchased electricity. The breakup is provided as required in the table below.

8. Does the entity ha
ve any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details76.
 Yes. T
CS has taken up the target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon footprint by 70% by 2025 and become net 
zero by 2030. To achieve these targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key levers – green infrastructure, green IT, IT-enabled operational efficiencies, and renewable energy.
 Commitment t
o Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
 In June 2022, TCS has r
esponded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero 
through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking action - https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action. TCS is working on the next steps to developing company targets for validation by SBTi.
 Green In
frastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:
 All new c
ampuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have 
roof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. The total Built Up Area occupied by TCS has increased YoY from 36.6 Mn to 38.23 million sq.ft. in FY 2023-24. With the increasing footprint, TCS is committed to expand consciously its green footprint, to align with its sustainability goals. In FY 2023-24, TCS got Platinum IGBC certification for 2 additional existing buildings namely Sholinganallur, Chennai and Deccan Park, Hyderabad. The % green certified area over built up area was 64.6% in  
FY
 2022-23 and has incr
eased to 67.3% this year. This accounts for 39 TCS offices and campuses with over 25.74 million sq.ft of 
area under certified green building by Indian Green Building Council.
75  GRI 305-1; GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4. Scope 1 emissions have been calculated using the emissions factors published by the DEFRA conversion factors 2023. For Scope 2 emissions – for India, the source is the emission factor is the CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector, User Guide, Version 19.0, December 2023, published by the Central Electricity Authority of India. This emission factor [(0.716 tCO2/ MWh) by CEA includes the captive power injection into the grid and is adjusted for RE transactions through open access (in power exchanges)]. As TCS, India procures electricity from the India grid, which is a mix of conventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.716 tCO2/ MWh is considered more appropriate. For Australia, Canada, North America, and UK emission factors specific to the region published by local authorities are used. For other countries IEA v6 emission factors (01/2024) and GHG protocol v19 (04/2023) – eGRID 2021 have been used as appropriate to the source of electricity procured.

83  GRI 305-3, GRI 305-4; There are some inclusions and modifications in estimating scope 3 carbon emissions during FY 2024 when compared to FY 2023. Scope 3 emissions:  
Category 1 & 2: Emission factors (spend based) for purchased and capital goods are taken from the latest available US EPA (Supply Chain GHG 
Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries v1.1.1) information for computer equipment, electrical equipment, office equipment, vehicles, and furniture items. The US EPA emission factors for categories 1 & 2 were adopted in FY23 and used in FY24 as well. There is a significant increase in Category 1 due to a new contract. Increase in category 2 is due to Return to Office (RTO)  Category 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category since  FY 2023 and the same has been continued in FY2024 as well. There is an increase in emissions due to use of IEA emission factors for WTT and T&D in FY24. In FY23 the Company had used the DEFRA emission factors.  Category 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to other supplies. While the Company continues to capture emissions from transportation of IT assets based on spend based emission factors, emissions related to transportation of non -IT supplies were included. The non – IT supplies covered to estimate category 4 emissions include cafeteria/ canteen supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material, and other stationary supplies. Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2023 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. There is a significant decrease in this category as the actual data were taken from the locations in FY24 compared to FY23 which was based on pilot study at few locations. The Company has also moved the waste disposal related transport emissions from Category 4 to 5 in FY24. .  
Category 5: No change in approach in FY 2024. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2023. Slight increase in emission due to increased RTO and also due to inclusion of waste disposal related transportation under this category.  
Category 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023 and FY 2024, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2023.  There is an increase in emissions due to increase in business travel and accommodation due to resumption and RTO. Category 7: In FY 2024, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees, personal employee commute, public employee commute & work from home (WFH) emissions. There is an increase in employee commute due to RTO in FY 2023-24 compared to previous year.

All climate-related risks are embedded into entity’s overall risk management process. TCS has an internal application where identified risks 
are baselined at the beginning of the year, tracked quarterly and updated with relevant progress. Each risk has an expiry date. Each risk owner responds with the progress and at the end of the financial year ensures closing of the risk.
Section 4: Metrics and targets
Climate related metrics
a.
 Climat
e-related metrics – Scope 1,2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent are disclosed on 
page number 152, 158 of the BRSR report. The emissions are in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standards. TCS has a robust environmental sustainability tool where all relevant environmental data are collected monthly, validated, and internally assured periodically across geographies. All locations within the operational control of TCS are included in the boundary of environmental data reporting (consolidated accounting group as per IFRS-S2). GHG emission factors are used from the latest version of IEA, DEFRA, USEPA, GHG Protocol All Sector Tools and regional sources for specific geographies (e.g. CEA for India) to estimate the GHG emissions. The approach, inputs and assumptions are detailed on Page number 152, 158 as part of the BRSR section. The carbon emission data is independently assured by external assurance providers at the end of the financial year. In FY
 2024, sc
ope 1 and 2 emissions have undergone reasonable assurance and scope 3 has been subject to limited assurance by 
KPMG. TCS reports its scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in the Integrated Annual Report and in CDP (Climate change) disclosures.

f.
 Int
ernal carbon prices:
 The org
anization has calculated an internal carbon price based on the total investments envisaged for energy efficiency programs, 
transition to renewable energy and other investments towards emission reductions. Currently TCS does not apply this carbon price to determine the feasibility of projects or to apply a carbon tax to generate funding for the projects. All these projects and initiatives are driven through internal accruals since they align to overall company and Tata Group philosophy. Currently, TCS is not focusing on offsetting to drive reductions and the company may take up the carbon cost/tax mechanism in the future to generate budgets for purchase of offset instruments. In the coming years, the company may plan to consider applying a carbon tax to business travel (and employee commuting-company provided transport) to bring out the “carbon” cost. This will help reduce Category 6 and 7 of Scope 3 emissions by either reducing travel or switching to carbon efficient means of travel and transportation (like EVs). The price for each metric tonne of greenhouse gas emissions the entity uses to assess the costs of its greenhouse gas emissions is ₹ 2,365.
 Business decision-making processes this in
ternal carbon price is applied to are:
 • Capital e
xpenditure 
 • Opera
tions procurement 
 • Risk managemen
t 
 • Opportunity managemen
t
 • Value chain eng
agement
Remuneration:  Refer page number 103 for information on remuneration of the Board members. 
Climate-related targets
TCS’ climate related targets are mentioned along with its metrics, timeline, and performance in page 24, 25 of the Natural Capital section. 
In May 2021, TCS set carbon target of 70% reduction of absolute Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 2025 (vs base year 2016) and Net Zero by 2030. This target setting is aimed to mitigate the carbon emissions from its activities and enables adapting to climate change risks. The target applies to the entity in entirety across geographies. TCS has already achieved 71% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY 2023 (Vs 2016) and 80% reduction in FY 2024 (Vs 2016) thereby overachieving the targets much ahead of its timelines. 
The performance against the targets is disclosed in this Integrated Annual Report in the Natural Capital Section on Page numbers 24 and 25. TCS has made its commitment to SBTi targets. In June 2022, TCS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by 
committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking action - Science Based Targets. TCS is working towards submitting the targets for validation by SBTi.

TCS Climate Related Disclosures
In FY 2023, TCS’ climate related disclosures were aligned to the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Subsequently, 
TCFD fulfilled its remit and was disbanded in October 2023. 
The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) released IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures, in January 2024, which is aligned 
with the recommendations of TCFD. This year, TCS has disclosed information related to climate-related risk and opportunities aligned with IFRS S2. IFRS S2 applies to disclosure of (1) climate related risks (physical and transitional), to which the entity is exposed and (2) climate related opportunities available to the entity. 
The disclosure requirements in IFRS S2 are structured around the core content related to the following sections: Section 1: Governance
Section 2: StrategySection 3: Risk ManagementSection 4: Metrics and TargetsEach of the above topics are addressed below.
Section 1: Governance
TCS has a Board level Stakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC) that oversees different aspects of climate-related risks and opportunities. 
Stakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC)•
 The SRC is chair
ed by an independent director and comprises of 3 members including the CEO. It reviews the climate change 
strategy, approach, and performance of the organization with respect to sustainability and climate change. 
• The SRC f
ormally meets twice every year to review policies and sustainability performance, including climate change and carbon 
performance. The board oversight helps drive the program effectively with greater accountability. 
• The CEO
, as a part of the SRC, is directly responsible for the efficient operations of the facility and hence is better able to review 
performance and drive improvement. The updates are provided by the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and is supported by 
the Head - Environmental Sustainability, Health and Safety (ESHS) who oversees the environment and climate change implementation at the organisation. 
•
 TCS
’ carbon reduction goal to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 70% by 2025 (over 2016 
base year), and to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, was reviewed and approved by the committee.
• Sta
tement by Senior management: Refer page number 132 in BRSR for N G Subramaniam, COO & Executive Director’s statement. 
• During the half yearly mee
tings, the SRC monitors the progress towards the carbon targets and the carbon reduction initiatives that 
have been implemented and planned.
Competency: 
TCS has a competent team working on Environmental Sustainability. TCS’ Head - Environmental Sustainability, Health, and Safety (ESHS) is 
a Doctorate in Environmental Science and Engineering and has over 30 years of post-doctoral experience in environmental sustainability and climate change.  The ESHS team has recruited professionals who have the requisite qualification and experience in climate change and environmental sustainability. The team has undergone training in advanced topics and regularly participates in external training programs and sessions on the emerging frameworks and regulatory requirements around climate change.
TCS is also a member of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and National Association of Software and Services Companies 
(NASSCOM), and the company participates as panelist, assessor, or speaker in their training and capacity building workshops on climate change with the perspective of spreading know-how on ESG, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies among other industries.  
Remuneration:  Refer page number 103 for information on remuneration of the Board members.
Apart from the SRC, TCS also has the Risk Management Committee (RMC) that is responsible for risk management oversight at the 
corporate level.

Climate related  
scenarioParameters, assumptions, analytical choices
Transition scenarios IEA B2DSThe climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS takes a multi-level approach to identify climate risk and opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-down analysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included,
a)
 natu
re loss and ecological degradation, 
b) resour
ce scarcity and driving value chain innovation, 
c) changing cus
tomer and workforce preferences, 
d) the rise of e
xtreme weather, 
e) increasing r
egulations, pricing and disclosure of externalities, 
f) digit
alization and prevalence of infectious diseases and 
g) rising inc
omes.
Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change transition risks and opportunities across value chain 
and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value driver analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition). In the transition scenario, the IEA B2DS approach has been selected as its more conservative scenario. The inputs included those from Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) reports, the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand. Changing customer behaviour and carbon costs are assessed as a transition risk to TCS with a growing number of jurisdictions at regional and national level planning to implement a carbon tax or emission trading scheme.

Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change physical risks and opportunities across value chain 
and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value drivers’ analysis assesses them across 3 stages of the value chain including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition) The physical risk is assessed using the RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 8.5 scenario takes a global warming between 3-4 degrees above pre-industrial levels which is a conservative scenario and helps TCS understand the worst-case climate impacts on its operations. The inputs included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Govt. of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand. Few strategies to mitigate physical risks of climate change include:
1)
 A robus
t Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to respond to climate events 
2) Inv
estments in climate resilient infrastructure (for cyclone, floods).
Section 3: Risk management
At TCS, the Corporate Risk Office, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for driving Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) across all functions in line with TCS Global Risk Management Policy. Refer the MD&A section on page numbers 78, for details on how ERM is driven across the company on all topics, including climate related risks and opportunities. The company also considers evolving concepts, trends, policies, customer requirements, regulations, and climate scenario analysis to identify Risk & Opportunities. The company also considers international guidelines/frameworks like GRI, SASB, and CDP for Risk & Opportunity drivers.

 Area Description of in fluence
Supply chain and/
or value chainSupply Chain sustainability through responsible sourcing is one of the risk mitigations that TCS has identified under its sustainability risk. TCS’s Green Procurement policy outlines its commitment to making its supply chain more responsible and sustainable. Energy efficiency is one of the major procurement considerations in all the company’s IT assets procurement as this is directly correlated with its emission profile. Climate related risks play a very important role in supply chain engagements, and TCS is working with its suppliers to bring in improvements in overall supply chain sustainability related aspects. As mentioned in the previous section on suppliers, TCS has launched the supplier sustainability assessment platform to facilitate improvements in the supply chain through evaluation and assessment of suppliers.
Investment in R&I TCS’ investments in R&I have resulted in solutions like Envirozone™, Clever Energy and IP2™. TCS has been using Clever Energy for the last several years to monitor and help reduce its energy consumption and is now commercially selling it and the other two solutions to clients to help them achieve their sustainability goals. Additionally, TCS has been investing in building green campuses (IGBC certified). These initiatives have enabled reduction of carbon footprint
Operations Climate Change risks play an important consideration in TCS’ operations. TCS has created an environmentally sustainable approach by creating green policies, processes, frameworks, and infrastructure. The company’s campuses are designed to withstand extreme weather events and the business continuity plans are tested periodically to ensure continued operations without any disruption. Green buildings, efficient operations, green IT, the use of renewable energy to reduce carbon footprint; adoption of newer technologies and methods to manage waste in line with circular economy principles are integral to business operations. These all help the company in achieving its emission reduction targets and journey towards Net Zero by 2030.
Direct costs, Capital expenditures, Capital allocation assetsClimate risks and opportunities are one of the factors while making financial considerations especially while making investments in offices, equipment, and renewable energy production. Investment in these areas constitutes a substantial share of the company’s overall capital investment. Major investments are in green buildings, roof top solar and other energy efficiency initiatives. Refer BRSR section, Principle 6, page number 152, 153 for more details on the initiatives that also help the company to position itself as leaders in the climate domain hence contribute substantially to its market value.
Financial position, financial performance, and cash flows
Substantive financial or strategic impact of Risk Assessment: Climate risks like business disruption, changing regulatory landscape, acute physical stress and transition risks are identified, prioritized, 
assessed and managed by the ERM team. Anything with the potential to disrupt regular operations by more than 10% and triggers Business Continuity Plans at the sites is considered as substantial. The financial risk exposure is calculated considering the following quantifiable indicators - (1) Proportion of business units affected OR percentage of operations impacted; (2) Probability of occurrence of extreme climate related events, and 3) the impact potential at the affected locations based on size of operation. In any given year the overall potential financial impact due to an extreme weather event is considered as 0.75% of the revenue. TCS considers a risk tolerance of 10% of the exposure for climate related risks and considered as substantive. Based on the severity and the risk exposure, the appropriate risk response is finalized, and mitigation actions are assigned to relevant functions.
The company has identified the following climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the 
company’s business:
a.
 Risk of impact on direct oper
ations:  TCS has large operations based out of offices in coastal cities which have a high exposure to 
extreme weather events like high rainfall, cyclones, rise in sea level, etc. During FY 2024, there were no major cyclones that effected 
the company’s campuses. However, earlier event like Cyclone Amphan led to damages in its Kolkata, India campus specifically to the rooftop solar PV installations, solar water heater panels, roof mounted HVAC components, HRW electrical panel room, energy bin of biogas chamber, apart from multiple water leakages at basement and many other external physical damages. This indicates the increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods and the impact these can cause directly on the operations. TCS accounts for such risks at design stage through cyclone and flood water resistance considerations while constructing new buildings. For greenfield projects, the building structure is designed (a) for seismic load as per IS 1893 (Part-1) 2016; Amendment No:2-2020 and (b) for wind speeds as per IS 875 codes. 
 TCS has a s
trong business continuity plan (critical business operations can be shifted to another city/country/geography) and 
therefore these physical risks will not affect the business operations significantly, except for the financial implications related to infrastructure damages (if any). Hence the potential financial impact due to physical damage because of extreme weather events is calculated as a percentage of revenue using a risk factor, which in turn is arrived through the company’s risk assessment exercises. The potential financial impact will be 0.75% of the revenue which comes to approximately ₹ 1,807 crores or US$218 million.
b.
 Risk of increase in c
apital expenditure: TCS is an IT services, consulting, and business solutions organization with a presence across 
multiple geographies, industries, services and products. Being one of the frontrunners in ESG performance, in 2021, the company has taken up ambitious carbon targets as mentioned in previous sections and have also achieved its near-term targets 2 years ahead

    Integrated Annual Report 2023-24320 Sustainability Disclosures
Climate related 
R&OTCS Approach
Chronic physical Despite the Paris Agreement and global climate action, global warming continues unabated. Having presence in many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronic physical impacts like change in precipitation pattern, with resultant effects like drought or flood. Also, with TCS’s presence in few coastal cities, rise in sea level and related impacts like land submergence, saltwater intrusion, disruption to network and communication systems are more likely. These risks are long term and included from perspective of planning appropriate infrastructure. TCS has set targets to reduce carbon emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 70% in 2025 compared to 2016 base year and achieve Net Zero by 2030. These are aligned with the global goals taken under the Paris agreement to fight global warming by keeping the planet’s temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius. TCS has reduced its absolute carbon footprint across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 80% in FY 2024 over a baseline of 2016, exceeding TCS’ target achievement by 10%, one year ahead of time.
Business model and value chain
TCS’ business model and value chain includes its customers and suppliers. The sustainability and climate related transition risks are 
covered here along with some mitigation plans.
Customers: TCS is an IT services and business solution provider company working mostly with Fortune 1000 or Global 2000 corporations 
and the public sector. The customer perception around climate change risks has strengthened, especially in the major markets, and this is reflected in the increasing customer requests on climate change performance through platforms like CDP , SBTi commitment, RFPs. These all show how adapting to changing customer behaviour around climate change is crucial for business continuity.
TCS’ stakeholders, especially its customers and employees look at it as a responsible corporate citizen when it comes to climate action. 
The company’s efforts in this domain have been recognized through ESG ratings and CDP ratings / climate change performance (carbon reduction against targets, % renewable energy). In an event, if TCS is unable to meet its climate change commitments, it can lead to a negative impact on its brand and reputation, as well as ESG ratings. A failure to meet the targets, customer expectations or evolving regulatory requirements could also potentially affect its market capitalization. TCS ensures that these risks are identified at an early stage and work on mitigation and improvement plans.
