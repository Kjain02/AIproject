Criticism from 2024 Pro-Palestine Encampment [ edit ]

On May 1, 2024, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) San Diego organized and established a campsite on Library Walk Lawn, next to UC San Diego Health Clinic, to protest against Israeli military operations in Palestine. The encampment lasted until May 6, when it ended with police forces in riot gear and carrying batons disassembling the camps and dispersing the protesters. Police arrested 64 individuals (40 students and 24 non-affiliates) during the operation.[26] All arrested individuals were later released on the same day.

Following this operation, UCSD and Chancellor Khosla received criticism from various organizations, students, and faculty members. Critics focused on the use of police force against what they described as a peaceful protest and the perceived intimidation tactics used during the encampment.[27]

University correspondence stated that the decision to deploy police forces was due to concerns over campus safety and accessibility, claiming the encampment had severely disrupted these aspects as it had grown to three times its original size. The Office of the Chancellor also issued several notices reminding the community that the encampment was in violation of San Diego law and UCSD policy, citing potential consequences such as interim suspension, contract termination (in the case of UCSD staff), or arrest. Critics, however, challenged these claims and pointed to the use of police as a significant issue.

The Literature, Ethnic Studies, and Music departments of UCSD released statements in opposition to the University's handling of the encampment, signed by some of their respective faculty members. Among other demands, some of these letters demanded Khosla's resignation and a reevaluation of UCSD's protest policies. On the students' side, the presidents of the student councils of Revelle College, Warren College, Eleanor Roosevelt College, and John Muir College issued statements similarly in opposition to the University and Khosla. Jewish Voice for Peace and the Student Promoted Access Center for Education and Services released similar statements. The United Auto Workers (UAW) decided to vote for authorization to strike in response to the clearing of the encampment, as union members were among those arrested. The Associated Students, Che Cafe Collective, Groundworks Bookstore, General Store Collective, UC San Diego Food Cooperative, and KSDT Radio also expressed their solidarity with the Gaza Solidarity Encampment and condemned the use of police.

Allegations of Professional Misconduct [ edit ]

Khosla was sued in June 2019 by former UC San Diego Associate Vice Chancellor of Health Sciences Jean Ford. Ford's lawsuit alleged that Chancellor Khosla verbally harassed and discriminated against female employees during her time at UCSD.[28] A settlement was reached in 2020.[29] In November 2022, the UC Regents and Compliance and Audit Officer of UC Regents, Alexander Bustamente, were sued for retaliation in violation of labor codes regarding a whistleblower complaint investigation of Khosla in 2018. The lawsuit alleged that, "the UC Regents and Bustamente protected Khosla by choosing not to allow investigations into gender discrimination allegations against Khosla and by removing[...]submitted findings regarding Khosla’s bullying, alcohol use, discrimination, and other inappropriate and illegal behavior."[30] The investigation involved nine current and former UCSD employees.[31][32]
